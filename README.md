## Overview

My attempt at creating a solution for Frontend Mentor's QR Code Component Challenge. 

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was my first attempt at a coding project that didn't include a code-along. Initially, I had overthought the use of flexbox, and after quite a bit of back and forth googling of elements and referencing MDN I found a way to organize everything to suit my needs. 

I received a lot more hands on CSS practice, and have improved my understanding of it. 

### Continued development

I plan to attempt more recreations to improve my understanding of how HTML and CSS work together. Building a solid foundation of what makes up webpages will be important for me as I progress forward. 

Flexbox is something I would like to delve further into, and attempting this challenge has helped me see the areas which I will need more study. 

### Useful resources
